# Proximap
Proximap is a responsive web app for finding nearby public infrastructure, and uses drinking fountains as a showcase example.
It is being developed in conjunction with [Datablue](//github.com/mmmatthew/datablue), a tool for collecting and aggregating
data from open government data repositories and the Wikicommons websites. Check out [water-fountains.org](//water-fountains.org)
for more information on the overall project.

The project is open source under the GNU Affero General Public License, with a profit contribution agreement applying under restricted conditions. See [COPYING](/COPYING) for information.

## Vision
A mockup has been created with Figma to illustrate how proximap could look. See it [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/VtlRvM4aWOWYIEL2j7EcCeVk/water-fountains.org?scaling=contain&node-id=1%3A30). See the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap.md) for planned milestones.
