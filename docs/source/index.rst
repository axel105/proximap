Welcome to ProxiMap's documentation!
====================================
Proximap is a responsive web app for finding nearby public infrastructure, and uses drinking fountains as a showcase example.
It is being developed in conjunction with `Datablue <//github.com/mmmatthew/datablue>`_, a tool for collecting and aggregating
data from open government data repositories and the Wikicommons websites. Check out `water-fountains.org <//water-fountains.org>`_
for more information on the overall project.

The project is open source under the GNU Affero General Public License, with a profit contribution agreement applying under restricted conditions. See `COPYING <//github.com/mmmatthew/proximap/blob/master/COPYING>`_ for information.
